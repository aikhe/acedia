        Im writing this base of all the things that have happened and the current situation im in.
        Ever since college started, I've been experiencing a lot of things that someone should have
        later on find later in life, may it being stressed and worrying about the future, my current
        financial status, my social life, and my education.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        <strong>
          There's a lot I've discovered just because of that nagging feeling to know what I really
          want in life. This state of curiosity has led to my present decisions, decisions that can
          be the end of everything, decisions that could lead me where I really want to be or the
          decision that will secure my future.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Before I take on explaining what have happened throughout all of this, first is I wanna list
        down all the things that I'm willing to share since all things considered, some part of life
        should just be private.
