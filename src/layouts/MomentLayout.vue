        Im writing this base of all the things that have happened and the
        <strong>current situation im in</strong>. Ever since college started, I've been experiencing
        a lot of things that someone should have later on find later in life, may it being
        <strong>stressed and worrying about the future</strong>, my
        <strong>current financial status</strong>, my <strong>social life</strong>, and my
        <strong>education</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        There's a lot I've discovered just because of that
        <strong>nagging feeling to know what I really want in life</strong>. This state of curiosity
        has led to my present decisions, decisions that can be
        <strong>the end of everything</strong>, decisions that could lead me
        <strong>where I really want to be</strong> or the decision that will
        <strong>secure my future</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Before I take on explaining what have happened throughout all of this, first is I wanna list
        down all the things that I'm willing to share since all things considered,
        <strong>some part of life should just be private</strong>.
