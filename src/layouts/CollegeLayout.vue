          This is the place where most could only dream of especially the ones with scholarships, im
          one of this people. I passed the exam and so have the privilage to have a free education.

        Having passed and getting into this UNI, people in my life are happy and proud. This is the
        oppurtunity that most can't just disregard, and so as I see the results I feel thankful. I
        chose my dream course "Computer Science" as this has been on my main quest ever since I
        developed a love and passion for building using computer languages and my creativity.
        College start the fire inside me, igniting as it expects and long for such experience that I
        could only get within here. And so it all started, I love most of the subjects especially my
        majors and math subject and I'm really grateful for being in a healthy environment with
        these amazing teachers and fun classroom.

          Some time have passed and I've noticed how overly reliant I was to my mother and other
          people in my life for financial reasons and it's really killing me inside. I've also
          noticed the lack of challenge that some of my subjects and majors are providing as im
          learning more from my own rather than college itself. My health have also not been in a
          great state and have been struggling to keep my education seriously. Whilst these bad
          things are happening I've also lost the motivation, passion, and drive to keep myself in
          touch with what I should be doing that will kept my future secure and healthy. I have been
          slowing losing myself.

        This unfortunate time and experience manifested through my education for the past 3 months.
        I was not going to most of my classes and have missed most of my exams. Our finals have
        passed and so my record is, I have dropped most my subjects this first semester.
