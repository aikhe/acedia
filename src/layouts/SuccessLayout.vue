          Throughout this whole failure there's this small spark that keeps me from completely
          losing it all, "Success" my final project for the first semester in one of my majors.
          Trying and giving my time to finish this project has been one of my coping mechanisms.

        From the word "success", UCC has been a big part of this system as it provides the tools to
        make each UCCian, may it be teachers and students, studying more free, accessible, fun and
        easier considering that most software that provides the same feature has a paywall to them
        and so not accessible especially to us students. It has a fine-tuned AI model from Hugging
        Face and Gemini with graphRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) that supports each user a
        specialized chatbot base of UCC. This system also has features for students and teachers
        such as custom quizzes and flashcard generator, a centralized hub for each user in UCC to
        give, share and collaborate, and much more. I've also made an external library to handle TUI
        (terminal user interface) beautifully entirely in C language that is used for Success which
        can also be useful to other developers.

        What's really ironic is that this system is made primarily focused to students and teachers
        looking for software to make their studying easier such as myself but the one who made it
        was the one who failed all of his subjects because of certain circumstances in his life.

          This has been a crucial part of my failure as it gives me a sense of comfort and helped me
          discover more of myself. Yes, we've got an almost perfect score for this project and it
          did put a smile on my face but one thing for sure is that this success is only one percent
          of what it will take to climb back from my failing grades.

          Ever since finishing this project, it taught me things that cannot just be learned in
          school alone. It showed me the burning passion I have for technology, the drive to build
          meaningful software, and the overwhelming love to put the highest quality of work I can
          give.
        </strong>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Building and learning more about technology has taught me more than I have ever expected,
        without the need for a proper education. It showed me that "Success" cannot only be made
        within a classroom, but also within a person whose energy is consumed by one's own desire
        and longing to find reasons to make and achieve much more despite the struggles, failures,
        and bad circumstances in their lives.
