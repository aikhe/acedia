        Throughout this whole <strong>failure</strong> there's this small spark that keeps me from
        <strong>completely losing it all</strong>, "Success" my final project for the first semester
        in one of my majors. Trying and giving my time to finish this project has been one of my
        coping mechanism.

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        From the word "success", ucc has been a big part of this system as it provides the tools to
        make each uccians may it be teachers and students studying more free, accessible, fun and
        easier considering that most software that provides the same feature has a paywall to them
        and so not accessible especially to us students. It has a fine-tuned ai model from hugging
        face and gemini that supports each users a specialized chatbot base of ucc. This system also
        have features for students and teachers such as custom quizes and flashcard generator, a
        centralized hub for each user in ucc to give, share and collaborate, and much more. I've
        also made an external library to handle tui (terminal user interface) beautifully entirely
        in c language that is used for success which can also be useful to other developers.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        What's really <strong>ironic</strong> is that this system is made primarly focused to
        students and teachers looking for a software to make their studying easier and the one who
        made it was the one who literally failed all of his subjects because of certain circumstance
        in his life.

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        This has been a crucial part of my failure as it give me a sense of comfort and helped me
        discover more of myself. Yes, we've got an almost perfect score for this project and it did
        put a smile on my face but one thing forsure is that this success is only one percent of
        what it will take to climb back from my failing grades.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Eversince finishing this project, it taught me things that cannot just be learned on school
        alone. It showed me the burning passion I have for technology, the drive to build meaningful
        software, and the overwhelming love to put the highest quality of work I can give.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Building and learning more about technology has taught me more than I have ever expected,
        without the need for a proper education or college. It showed me that "Success" can not only
        be made within a classroom, but also within a person who's enery is consumend by one's own
        desire and longing to find reasons to make and achieve much more despite the struggles,
        failures, and bad circumstances in their lives.
