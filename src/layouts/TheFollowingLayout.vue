        Finals comes to an end, and as my final grades come in, I've expected myself to fail ever
        since it started. Even the unfortunate time and failure I've experienced, my first semester
        has been the best experience I could ever have asked for, it gave me the time to reflect
        deeply about what I really am and what I want to do in life, I have nothing but gratefulness
        for the growth and insight I've gained.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        <strong>
          If I still have a chance to continue to the second semester, I would gladly take it and
          make the most out of it, hoping it will give me the clarity and purpose I need to deepen
          my connections within UCC and keep pursuing a computer science degree.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Even then, Im also ready to take and pursue my own direction when life leads me to a
        different direction. Whether that means stepping away or exploring opportunities outside the
        "traditional path". I have a deep knowing that my own path doesn't have to look like anyone
        else's and it may be a journey that include the most intense hardship or a peace that'll
        make my future self proud.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        To close this, I want to list the possibilities I should be aware of, the resposibilities I
        should have and the opportunities I can have by taking a non-traditional path could offer
        me.
