        Throughout this whole <strong>failure</strong> there's this small spark that keeps me from
        <strong>completely losing it all</strong>, "<strong>Success</strong>" my final project for
        the first semester in one of my majors. Trying and giving my time to finish this project has
        been one of my <strong>coping mechanisms</strong>.

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        From the word "<strong>success</strong>", UCC has been a big part of this system as it
        provides the tools to make each UCCian, may it be teachers and students, studying more
        <strong>free, accessible, fun and easier</strong> considering that most software that
        provides the same feature has a paywall to them and so not accessible especially to us
        students. It has a <strong>fine-tuned AI model</strong> from Hugging Face and Gemini that
        supports each user a specialized chatbot base of UCC. This system also has features for
        students and teachers such as <strong>custom quizzes and flashcard generator</strong>, a
        centralized hub for each user in UCC to give, share and collaborate, and much more. I've
        also made an
        <strong
          >external library to handle TUI (terminal user interface) beautifully entirely in C
          language</strong
        >
        that is used for Success which can also be useful to other developers.

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        What's really <strong>ironic</strong> is that this system is made primarily focused to
        students and teachers looking for software to make their studying easier such as myself but
        the one who made it was the one who
        <strong>literally failed all of his subjects</strong> because of certain circumstances in
        his life.

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        This has been a crucial part of my failure as it gives me a sense of comfort and helped me
        discover more of myself. Yes, we've got an <strong>almost perfect score</strong> for this
        project and it did put a smile on my face but one thing for sure is that this
        <strong>success is only one percent</strong> of what it will take to climb back from my
        failing grades.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Ever since finishing this project, it taught me things that cannot just be learned
        <strong>in school alone</strong>. It showed me the
        <strong>burning passion I have for technology</strong>, the drive to
        <strong>build meaningful software</strong>, and the
        <strong>overwhelming love to put the highest quality of work I can give</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="margin--medium font-plex-sans font-desc">
        Building and learning more about technology has taught me
        <strong>more than I have ever expected</strong>, without the need for a proper education or
        college. It showed me that "<strong>Success</strong>" cannot only be made within a
        classroom, but also within a person whose
        <strong>energy is consumed by one's own desire and longing</strong> to find reasons to make
        and achieve much more despite the
        <strong>struggles, failures, and bad circumstances</strong> in their lives.
